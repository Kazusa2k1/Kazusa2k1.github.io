<h1 style="text-align: center">My experience with games</h1>

<p>To be honest, I wasn't too much into games when I was a kid. A lot of my friends went to net cafes to play LOL, Dota or PES, while I
didn't at all. Part of the reason was that I only had a Macbook, so basically I couldn't play anything even if I wanted to. Once, I
tried to install Windows 8 on my Mac. It worked fine initially, but crashed multiple times later on, so I scratched that idea immediately.</p>

<p>The first time I've genuinely wanted to play a game was right after I finished the Fate anime series, including FSN 2006, Fate/Zero
and FSN/UBW. I absolutely loved Fate - it remains my favorite action anime up until today. I soon learned of Fate/grand order and started
with the movie, which was not too interesting. That's why I decided to play FGO, to see if the original source was better, and boy it was!
The storyline was very thrilling, and I was completely hooked. That's probably when I realized the joy of playing games and visual novels
in general.</p>

<p>I started playing Genshin Impact in early 2021. Before that, I had already known how popular the game was. However, I often tended
to stay away from stuff that were too mainstream. As a medium gets popular, people will discuss it everywhere, which soon makes it boring,
at least to me. Nevertheless, I couldn't stop myself from exploring an open-world game, and Genshin Impact delivered just that. I'm really
glad that I decided to try this game out. I got into Honkai Impact 3 in the later half of 2021, probably because I was desperate for another gacha game ðŸ˜‚ The main story is really
good, and yes, quite dark. I can only pray that our characters will get the happiness they deserve. </p>

<p>As for PES 2021, before I downloaded it on my laptop, I had played the game many times in net cafes with my friends. Playing PES on PS4,
and even PS5 for once was a completely different experience. Other times, I came to my friend's place to play. He had a good gaming laptop,
so PES ran as smooth as we liked. He even came up with the brilliant idea of buying two controllers and a HDMI to connect his laptop to the
TV. It worked well most of the time, even comparable to the PS4 at net cafes. Welp, my laptop is not a gaming one, so PES can be quite
laggy at times, but I could bear with it.</p>
