<h1 style="text-align: center">My experience with anime</h1>

<p>My first encounter with the term "Anime" dated back to my 8th grade. One of my friends asked me if I watched any anime. At that time, I even thought
"Anime" was a certain movie, so I gave him a confused look and denied it, not knowing that I had already seen an anime: Detective Conan. DC has probably been
one of the most well-known anime in Vietnam, comparable to Naruto or Dragon Ball. As far as I remember, in 6th grade, I watched about a hundred episodes of
Conan with my lil sis, before calling it quits. I don't remember when I decided to continue with the series, until I eventually finished catching up to a
thousand episodes, which remains the only long one I've seen so far. My next ones include Magic Kaito, which is directly related to Conan, and Death Note,
which also belongs to the mystery genre. L remains one of my favorite male characters - a character who is incredibly smart and composed, and his battle of
wits against Light is insanely fierce.</p>

<p>After the initial phase, I decided to watch some mainstream ones, including, SAO, AOT and Tokyo Ghoul. I was a huge fan of these three series during then,
to the point that I didn't think there could be any better anime. The more I watched, the more I realized how mistaken I was. At the end of 2017, I delved
into the complicated worlds of Toaru and Fate, both of which remain to be one of my favorites, not only in terms of anime. I also really enjoyed Konosuba
at first, thanks to the recommendation from Brian Vu, but soon grew out of interest. From 2018 until now, I've watched a mixture of mainstream ones (FMAB for example) and
a lot of modern short ones. I also started getting into seasonal anime, a habit I still keep up with. Up to now, I think I've seen somewhere between 100 and
200 anime in total. Don't judge this number based on MAL: they include all seasons, movies and stuff in a single series. For instance, I only consider
Detective Conan a single series, whereas MAL includes the main anime as well as all of its movies and OVAs,...</p>

<p>How do I find anime to watch? Well, I've had a MAL account for quite a while. At first I could count the number of anime there by my fingers, which have
grown exponentially until now. Whenever I watched a new series, I would update its info on MAL. Initially, I didn't record my dates of watching; however,
since I had an abundance of time in 2018, I decided to get an estimation of the dates for all of my previous series. Whenever I see an intriguing anime,
I will proceed to read the plot, and if that's cool as well, I'll add the anime to my plan-to-watch. Surprisingly, visuals are the first thing that I notice
for anime. That's why I tend to look for modern ones instead of the classics. Whenever a new (anime) season arrives, MAL updates their series accordingly,
and I check out the ones that look promising. That's one of the main source for my PTW; others include watching random anime scenes on Youtube. I used to
watch a great number of compilations, a habit that I've abandoned since they got me a ton of spoilers.</p>

<p>I'm not too sure when exactly but in 2020, one of my friends from Miami suggested that I should use AniList. I was very reluctant at first, since I knew
exactly how much time it took to record all of my anime, manga and light novels. Nevertheless, I soon learned the convenient idea of exporting from MAL to
AniList, so the whole process didn't take as much time as I thought. AniList allows me to score in a scale of 100, which is way superior to MAL. However, MAL
enables me to design my lists with wallpapers, greatly enhancing the visuals for my profile. Since then, I've made sure to update both of my profiles
constantly, even though it proves to be more challenging than I thought. </p>

<p>As I've mentioned, I often decide which anime to watch on my own, and I don't normally listen to recommendations. When I was a new fan, I usually followed
Brian Vu's suggestion, since he could be considered the one who introduced me to this amazing world. I was very fond of popular ones then, and honestly I still
don't think any of them are bad - they're just not among my favorites. Some of the notable recommendations from others to me include: FMAB from Mr. Ben Davis,
which I decided to watch after a year. Brian also persuaded me to get into Date A Live many times, and what a brilliant decision it was. Tuan Minh is a close
friend of mine whom I introduced some of the anime too. In turn, he's pretty crazy about Darling in the Franxx, and has told me many times to watch the show.
For some reason, I feel like the more someone recommends an anime to me, the more put off I become of that series, so I can't even consider watching DITF when
I scroll through my PTW.</p>

<p>My watching frequency used to be once a month. In the past, I usually felt that I needed a full month to digest the show, especially great ones. After
finishing up a series, I got a ton of work to do: download the music, save the openings or endings, following social media pages and groups to catch up
on the news... Sometimes, if I simply couldn't wait to see how the story goes, I would proceed to read the original version, whether manga or light novel.
Last year, my interests changed a little when I had my laptop: I started getting more into games and visual novels. My once-per-month habit is still kept
regularly though. Earlier this year, when I was working from home, I got extremely bored cause I had nothing to do. That was the first time I had ever
broken this rule of mine: I decided to watch Akuma no Riddle right after Inu x Boku SS. Tbh, it wasn't a great experience, since I was sleepy halfway through
the series. Nowadays, I still try to keep this habit of mine, while keeping myself busy with a lot of visual novels.</p>
