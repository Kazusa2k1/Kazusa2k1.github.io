<h3 style="margin-top: 150px">My experience</h3>

<p>Genshin Impact is undoubtedly one of the most popular games in the world in general, not just for mobiles. Soon after the game came out, literally all of
my friends know its name, and a lot of them recommended it to me. I was super reluctant at first because I had a tendency to stay away from the mainstream
stuff. At the time, I swore that the only online game I would ever play was FGO.</p>

<p>A few months after that, for some reason, I got bored. No, not of FGO, but I felt like I couldn't wait to see how an open-world game was like. Genshin Impact
provided just that, and based on how great people claimed it to be, I finally decided to try it out. The game literally blew my mind. The storyline is incredible,
and the gameplay is just amazing. This is a major difference to FGO, when we can't directly control characters (even though FGO's main storyline is still
better in my opinion). I felt in love with the characters immediately, especially Hu Tao, whose banner was around when I started Genshin Impact. The art and
animation is breathtaking: I often had to go for low resolution since my laptop and phone couldn't handle the heat; nevertheless, it has still been an
extraordinary experience. Normally, I always use my laptop, since the bigger the screen, the better to me (well if I have a PS4 or PS5 it'll be a different
story). I only use my phone when it's inconvenient to bring out the whole laptop, such as in parties and the time to farm came.</p>

<p>One of my favorite moments from the main storyline is the incredible fight in Liyue against Osial. The animation was absolutely spectacular - my hair
stood on end during the whole cutscene. Even though common knowledge is that protagonists always prevail, I was honestly worried about Lumine and her
Liyue compatriots. We did emerge victorious in the end, thanks to a devastating final blow from Ningguang, who had to sacrifice her Jade Chamber. Another one
was the battles in Inazuma. The first one was the Shogun's army against the Resistance, which was very intense at its peak. The scene of Baal trying to take
the vision from Thoma was thrilling to say the least: Lumine was cool af when she used her Electro power to fight against Baal. Our battle against the Shogun at
her own realm was definitely the toughest I've ever faced. I had to run all the time while she kept pursuing to attack me. The most challenging aspect was when
she decided to ban our players' skills, excluding Lumine's, who I didn't have in the main party. Besides, I also had a newly-acquired level 20 Ayaka Kamisato
at the time, and she had to face off a level 80 Raiden-Shogun. Ei's story in the second part was especially sweet - I was glad that Lumine was able to
dissuade her viewpoint on an unchanging Inazuma for eternity. </p>

<p>A lot of the events from Genshin Impact have captured my attention. The first to mention is Windtrace, without a doubt one of the most entertaining co-op events.
I was much better at being a hider, since I knew how to find a place to hide. For many locations, I had a specific place in mind, such as under the roof of
a house in Dawn Winery, while transforming to be a small box. That spot has had a 100% win-rate for me, while the record came nowhere close for other locations.
A lot of the time, I was scared shitless when I was chased all over the place. Theater Mechanicus reminds me of Plants vs Zombies: we literally plant tools
in different places to make sure that the hilichurls couldn't get to the target. Misty Dungeon is pretty cool for us to experience new characters.</p>

<p>In general, the art in Genshin Impact is very attractive, including characters and locations. Out of the three nations, my favorite one is Inazuma, Watatsumi
Island in particular. When I first saw the island in the trailer, I couldn't help but sing my praise out loud. Kokomi and the island's nature is such a good
match, giving off a dreamy vibe. Music is another great feature of this game. The OSTs I like the most include the Monstadt theme, Signora's battle theme and
the Teapot Realm theme. I'd say that all the Mihoyo staff deserve every praise possible.</p>

<p>The only major drama I've seen in the community so far is the 1-year anniversary rewards. A great number of players complain about this, voting 1-star
on Google Play as well as App Store, and threatening to quit the game. My take on this is that, sure, it'd be nice to have a lot of good rewards. Nonetheless,
even if the prizes we get are not up to our satisfaction, I'll still be able to enjoy the game fully, thanks to the exhilarating story and wonderful characters.
Also, haters can just stop complaining after a bunch of primogems given when Mihoyo was nominated and won the Mobile Game of the year category. Hell, right
after the criticism, Genshin Impact still dominated the stores all over the world during the second Hu Tao's banner. </p>
