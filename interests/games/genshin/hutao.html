<h3>My impression of her</h3>
<p>The first time I've played Genshin Impact was during her first banner. Before that, I hadn't known anything about her at all. The
first time I saw her trailer was also when I realized how cute she was! She had the vibes of an onee-san who loves to tease her younger
brother, even though she's definitely smaller than you. The music was brilliant in capturing the adorable and silly side of Hu Tao.
  During that banner, I spent every single intertwined fate on her... in vain.
It was a pity, but I'd try my best to get her in the next one.</p>

<p>Hu Tao's story quest was hilarious! From her quest, I realized that she could be in her "serious" and "troll" mode at the same
time. The fact that everything was just Hu Tao's prank at the end was kinda a plot twist. Rie Takahashi's "You have been pranked"
  was just hilarious! I also listened to that voice line in other languages, but none could compare to her Japanese. Her voice line in the Teapot Realm was
quite a surprise for me. I interacted with her normally at first, trying out all of the options. The last one, which was when she whispered into my ears
"To be honest, I feel the same way about you," literally blew my mind. The first part of her sentence was indeed a whisper, but then she paused and emphasized
the last part. I was really glad that I didn't skip it, and had to replay it several times right after that. Moreover, I read a short dojinshi on Hu Tao's
confession to Aether, and it was so sweet! To be honest, that's the dream ending I'm hoping for Genshin Impact.</p>

<p>Finally, the time came for Hu Tao's second banner! When it was announced live on Genshin's discord stream, I was so excited and
really looked forward to version 2.3 update. However, my hopes kinda shattered when I opened the game after the update, only to see Childe
right in front of my eyes! That's when I realized that Hu Tao was gonna be in the second half of the version, and had no choice but to
patiently wait. The day soon came: I was in the middle of a meeting at TVSI, and 5pm was approaching. Right on cue, I opened the game and
immediately spent the 15 intertwined fates I had at the time. I was really hopeful, but did not get her during those attempts. I thought
maybe my luck ran out since I summoned Skadi earlier that day in FGO, along with Mona a few days earlier. I continued to farm for primogems
  and spent every one-wish on her banner. A few days later, a miracle occurred: I got Hu Tao at last! Thank you so much, Mihoyo for granting my
wishes of not only Hu Tao, but also all others who I have got. Also, thank you to all other characters as well - you guys have created
  an amazing story</p>

<p>Fun fact: Hu Tao's location in my room is on the upper side of the door leading to my dad's room.</p>
