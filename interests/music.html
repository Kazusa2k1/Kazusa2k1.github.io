<p>I've loved listening to music for as long as I can remember. Okay, maybe not that long, but I think it all started in 2012. I don't remember exactly what
caused it, but the reasons probably included my dad and WE10. Yeah, my earliest memories of music came from the time my dad and I watched WE10 - a music
chart in Vietnam. We would look forward to Friday nights when we could see which song would top the chart every week. I was so excited that I even went to
its website to vote for my favorite songs and hoped that they would rise to the top. There was even an award in January where they announced the best songs
and artists for the whole year, so it was kinda thrilling. Over time though, we didn't keep this habit, and WE10 wasn't on TV anymore. Moreover, I don't
even have any subscriptions on TV, and nowadays I always try to find links for free. WE10 is still around though, and their lists are uploaded on Facebook.
Usually, the charts are images, but it gets more dope when they use videos. This is still the main way for me to find new US-UK songs. Besides WE10, I used to check out Grammies and Billboard. Again, my dad was the one who invited me to watch Grammies. It was kinda cool seeing Bruno Mars,
Eminem and Taylor Swift getting some of the awards. Once, I got so into it that I uploaded the results right onto Facebook. I guess Billboard is more
accurate in terms of trendy songs, but WE10 is still my favorable chart as it suits my taste, probably as a Vietnamese.</p>

<p>Actually, I used to listen to K-pop as well as V-pop. I mean, WE10 includes both Western and Korean music, so it was no surprise. I thought that some of
the songs from T-Ara, BIGBANG and Monster were quite good, even now. The same goes for V-pop: I quite liked some of the ones I listened to. It's not that
I'm against listening to Korean and Vietnamese music, it's that I choose to only listen to Japanese and US-UK. You see, my phone already has around 2000 songs,
and I don't think there's any need to stuff any more. I mean, there's actually no way we can listen to all the songs that we like from all over the world -
there are just too many. The same goes for any other media - we can only read a specific number of books or watch certain movies, not all of them. That's
why I've chosen to stick with Western and Japanese music - they're just perfect for me.</p>

<p>My favorite means of listening to music is via speakers. Preferably, I'd choose a good one, but I actually want to save up my money so I don't spend on it.
My oldest speaker was a cheap one I got from Amazon for about $15, on a Black Friday 4 years ago. The quality was average, but it was cheap so I couldn't
complain. My second one was a major improvement - a JBL mini I got for $30 also on a Black Friday in Miami (Ohio). It was quite a bargain as it was
originally 60 bucks. I actually got this specific one as I saw one of my co-workers hung this on his pants. The sound got much better - I could hear the bass
quite clearly. One disadvantage was that it was quite fragile. I accidentally dropped it a few times, and its surface got completely shattered. For the first
year, I could still play music normally until its battery seemed kinda fucked. I had to charge the JBL much more regularly, to the point it couldn't survive
without charging anymore. When I couldn't even turn it on, I decided to resell it, but the speaker flew off when I was on my way. My cheap one is still
somewhere on the upper floors. Nowadays, I mainly listen by casting my phone to my TV. Its speakers obviously aren't as good as the original speakers,
but I've already made a decision to only spend on my main interests.</p>
